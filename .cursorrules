# SmartHire Project Rules

## Project Overview
SmartHire is a local-first recruitment platform with AI-powered candidate ranking.
All features work completely offline with zero cloud dependencies.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI
- Backend: Express.js, SQLite, Session-based Auth
- ML: Python FastAPI, scikit-learn

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all frontend code
- Use ES6+ features in backend
- Follow functional programming patterns where possible
- Use descriptive variable and function names

### Frontend
- All interactive components must use 'use client'
- Use Shadcn UI components consistently
- Implement proper loading states
- Show user-friendly error messages
- Make all pages responsive

### Backend
- Validate all inputs
- Use proper HTTP status codes
- Handle errors gracefully
- Log important operations
- Use transactions for multi-step operations

### ML
- Keep models small and fast
- Provide rationale for all predictions
- Use fallback when service unavailable
- Cache models in memory

### Database
- Use UUIDs for primary keys
- Index foreign keys
- Normalize data appropriately
- Use JSON for flexible schemas

### Security
- Hash all passwords with bcrypt
- Validate and sanitize inputs
- Use parameterized queries
- Set secure session cookies
- Implement proper CORS

## Local-First Principles
- No external API calls
- All data stored locally
- Works without internet
- ML models trained locally
- Self-contained deployment
